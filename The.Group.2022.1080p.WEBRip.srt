1
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:01,354
Shit.

2
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,669
I'm not sure you should be...

3
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:19,172
I'm fine. Much better.

4
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,839
Okay, but...

5
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:23,610
Do you have somewhere you can
go?

6
00:02:42,628 --> 00:02:43,662
AAT.

7
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:50,436
Hi, I'm here for the meeting.

8
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,411
Come on, come on. Hand them
over.

9
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:01,581
Dave, so glad you could make
it. Good to see you.

10
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,317
Well it's not like I have much
of a fucking choice is it?

11
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,686
Come on Henry, you know the
rules.

12
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:08,688
Okay, speak to you later.

13
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:13,525
Henry, do we have to do this
every week?

14
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:14,961
I dunno, do we?

15
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:37,682
Kara.

16
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:39,385
This is a surprise.

17
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:40,886
Hey Ellen.

18
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,354
Been a while.

19
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:46,759
After last time I honestly
didn't think we'd see you again.

20
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,113
Didn't think I'd be welcome.

21
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:49,261
Depends.

22
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:50,997
You planning on causing trouble?

23
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:52,932
It's been a rough night.

24
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,001
More than that, I'd say.

25
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,181
I just wanted somewhere to come
get my head straight.

26
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:59,872
If you don't want me here then,
whatever.

27
00:04:01,173 --> 00:04:02,441
Jesus.

28
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:05,778
Grab yourself a coffee, find
somewhere to sit, we start in twenty.

29
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:06,979
And hey...

30
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,948
Don't make me regret this.

31
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,684
Thanks.

32
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:15,297
Takes nothing to fall off the wagon,
and a lot to walk back through that door.

33
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:18,258
Figure anyone with that much
courage is worth my time.

34
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:20,659
Right.

35
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,781
This shit.

36
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:52,785
Every week this fucking shit.

37
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,188
You done?

38
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:02,395
Eddy, I said "Are you done?"

39
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:07,366
Eddy, I'm fucking talking to
you...

40
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,913
- I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
- It's alright.

41
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,004
It's just a spilt drink.

42
00:06:12,838 --> 00:06:13,840
It happens.

43
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,707
Right?

44
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,146
Fucking junkies.

45
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:22,615
Waste of my time.

46
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,522
Heard a commotion. Figured it
might be you.

47
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,391
Seth.

48
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:33,559
Sobriety suits you.

49
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,062
Who the fuck is that guy?

50
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:37,762
Dave?

51
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,066
Yeah, don't mind him.

52
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,068
Used to be police.

53
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:44,303
Maybe still is.

54
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,339
He's probably busted everyone
in the room at some point.

55
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,108
Yeah, I remember him.

56
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,042
Really?

57
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:50,943
Mm-hm.

58
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,078
What did he get you on?

59
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,178
Shoplifting.

60
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:56,348
And assaulting a police officer.

61
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:58,217
- Jesus.
- I know.

62
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:02,855
Well now here he is sitting
opposite you in a frigging circle.

63
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:07,727
Addiction. The great equaliser,
right?

64
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:13,632
What about you Eddy? Thought
you cleaned up.

65
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:17,002
I have, I've just not been
feeling too well.

66
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:19,915
- Think I'm coming down with something.
- Yeah, whatever man...

67
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,477
Listen, if Ellen catches you, you're
gonna be out on your arse, okay?

68
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:27,311
Go.

69
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:30,817
Get straightened out. I'll
cover for you, alright?

70
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,397
We've all been there.

71
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,804
Trying your hardest but the only time people
seem to notice is when you're fucking up.

72
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:55,241
He'll get there.

73
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:57,777
Yeah.

74
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,883
Helps with the aches.

75
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,220
Thanks.

76
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,992
So, how long you been on the
script?

77
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:15,226
Couple of weeks.

78
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:17,597
How much they got you on?

79
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,565
Not enough.

80
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:22,235
Sounds about right.

81
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,041
Look, it's tough but try and
get by without it.

82
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:33,579
So, what's going on Kay?

83
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,850
It's six months, no-one hears
from you and then you just rock up?

84
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:40,184
You been using?

85
00:08:41,987 --> 00:08:44,257
Just a wash. Nothing serious.

86
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,560
Just hospital serious, right?

87
00:08:47,993 --> 00:08:48,994
Fuck.

88
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,664
Yeah, you don't use when you're
on the script.

89
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,044
- You of all people should know that.
- Yeah, okay...

90
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,567
Okay, I fucked up.

91
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:57,614
I thought I could handle it and
I couldn't.

92
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,470
Lesson learnt.

93
00:08:58,604 --> 00:08:59,604
Yeah?

94
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,306
What's the difference this time?

95
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
This time?

96
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:04,609
I want it.

97
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,412
I need it.

98
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:12,016
Come on.

99
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,186
Better get back inside, yeah?

100
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,322
Hey, Seth?

101
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,764
Do you ever think about

102
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,799
stuff?

103
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,103
Hasn't done you any good.

104
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,273
See you're back already hanging
off Seth.

105
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,209
It's not like that.

106
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:11,744
Yeah, whatever.

107
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:13,979
He's been working really hard.

108
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
He's doing his steps.

109
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,449
The last thing he needs is a
distraction.

110
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,118
I guess you're the expert.

111
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:21,988
How long have you been clean
now?

112
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:24,690
Red for ninety days.

113
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,926
Blur for six months, right?

114
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,095
What's black for?

115
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:30,830
Two years.

116
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,331
Any advice?

117
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,667
Don't get ahead of yourself.

118
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:38,170
I doubt you'll even be here
next week.

119
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:43,142
Okay, let's get started.

120
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:50,049
Is everybody...?

121
00:10:51,383 --> 00:10:52,383
Here?

122
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:53,952
Goddammit Eddy.

123
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,789
You know, some of us actually
have places to be tonight.

124
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:14,040
Alright everyone. Up on your
feet. Let's do this.

125
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:15,841
Come on.

126
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:28,788
Grant me serenity
to accept the things I cannot change.

127
00:11:33,892 --> 00:11:36,495
The courage to change the
things I can.

128
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:41,233
And the wisdom to know the
difference.

129
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:53,312
We've all done things we are
not proud of.

130
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,882
Those who have them, get out
your lists.

131
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:58,217
Go on.

132
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,886
Hold them up in the air.

133
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,421
This is it.

134
00:12:04,422 --> 00:12:06,291
All the people we've hurt.

135
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:08,160
People we knew.

136
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,196
People who cared for us.

137
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:13,099
People we'll never see again.

138
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,236
Knowing that is not enough.

139
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:20,506
You need to be ready to take
the next step. To make amends.

140
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,843
Tough, right?

141
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,012
Probably the toughest thing
you've done.

142
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,614
But not the toughest thing
you're going to do.

143
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,550
We're going to have to make
good on it.

144
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:32,716
Yes.

145
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,287
But don't worry, we're not
there yet.

146
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:38,123
This is the past.

147
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:43,162
And recovery isn't just about the past. It can
be about the here and now... About the future.

148
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,831
Alright, tag meeting.

149
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:47,265
We're gonna go around the group.

150
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,636
I don't wanna hear the bad, I
wanna hear the good.

151
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,604
I wann hear one thing.

152
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,975
One good thing you've all done
recently.

153
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,510
Hey, come on!

154
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:01,313
It's two hundred steps across
that parking lot.

155
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,148
Two hundred.

156
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:06,018
These twelve should be a piece
of cake.

157
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:09,054
Come on. Who's up?

158
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:20,099
I've been helping out my sister
quite a bit.

159
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,637
She's got a kid and the Dad's
long gone, y'know?

160
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,674
So I've been taking him on
evenings.

161
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,943
Playing football with him and
that.

162
00:13:31,943 --> 00:13:33,178
It's not much.

163
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:35,881
It doesn't pay the bills or
anything but, erm.

164
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,217
It's something, I guess.

165
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:43,556
So, yeah.

166
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:45,824
Tag.

167
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:52,364
Okay, erm, last week I had my
first unsupervised visit with my son.

168
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,469
He's been living with his
Grandma.

169
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,972
I hadn't seen him for two months.

170
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:03,075
Her for about three years.

171
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,512
So I was nervous about going.

172
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,648
As soon as I got to the path,
she was there.

173
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:12,684
The door's open. Arms wide.

174
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:15,920
And for a split second I thought it
was because she wanted to see me.

175
00:14:16,387 --> 00:14:19,625
And then I realised it was that
she didn't want anyone else to.

176
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,265
I guess there are some things
you can't make right, so why try?

177
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:34,139
Anyway, positive.

178
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,275
My son.

179
00:14:37,475 --> 00:14:38,611
It's going well.

180
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:41,113
It's good.

181
00:14:43,649 --> 00:14:46,685
Henry, tag?

182
00:14:47,218 --> 00:14:49,387
Yeah, I'm not doing this.

183
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:53,492
Listen, I'll sit in this circle and I'll
fucking nod and get my stamp...

184
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,625
What's your problem?

185
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,461
No cross-talk please.

186
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,196
Same as everyone else.

187
00:14:58,496 --> 00:14:59,564
I got caught.

188
00:15:00,098 --> 00:15:01,567
You think you're different?

189
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,902
Tag fucking tag.

190
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:05,704
- What have you done this week?
- Yeah.

191
00:15:05,837 --> 00:15:08,340
That's it. Keep pushing
sunshine.

192
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:11,710
Is that a threat? Did you just
fucking threaten me?

193
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,614
Alright, okay. Let's cut this
off now.

194
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,619
Kara, why don't you go next?

195
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,655
Y'know what? I'm...

196
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,657
I'm not really feeling this
whole...

197
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,426
We're not here to sit in
judgement.

198
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,103
You've nothing to be afraid of.

199
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:30,628
Maybe I deserve to be judged.

200
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,464
You ever thought about that?

201
00:15:33,498 --> 00:15:35,567
Maybe there's no coming back
from what I did?

202
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,115
Yeah, this was a terrible idea.
I shouldn't have come.

203
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:43,241
Please. Don't. Stay.

204
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,111
Alright, knock it off Charley.
Come on...

205
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:47,111
Kara...

206
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,447
- Please...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

207
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:52,484
Somethings you can't make
right, so why try?

208
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,955
Interrupting something?

209
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,424
We're fine.

210
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,559
Can I help you?

211
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:07,599
This AAT, right?

212
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:08,765
Yes.

213
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:15,708
Name's Jack.

214
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,477
Well...

215
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:22,381
Hello Jack.

216
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,450
Hello Jack.

217
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:31,856
I'm late.

218
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:38,030
Wasn't sure I was gonna be
coming to be honest, but...

219
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,779
So how's this work then? We all sit
in a circle and have a bit of a moan?

220
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,651
It's called taking inventory
mate.

221
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,786
It's a lot of hard work.

222
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,790
Appreciate if you took it
seriously.

223
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,293
Yeah, I heard that commotion
from up the hallway.

224
00:17:09,594 --> 00:17:10,863
He pisses you off...

225
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,398
You wanna kill him...

226
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,234
She wants to leave...

227
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,969
Sounds like moaning if you ask
me.

228
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:19,371
Don't think we did.

229
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,075
It is moaning...

230
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,275
Bitching...

231
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:26,178
Whatever you wanna call it.

232
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,748
From the outside, maybe that's
all it looks like.

233
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,317
Maybe that's hard to hear but.

234
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:35,754
Accepting ourselves means
accepting we aren't perfect.

235
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:37,222
Speak for yourself.

236
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:41,893
When you accept that, you
accept you can improve, move on.

237
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:44,263
And what if you're a monster?

238
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,599
You just supposed to accept
that?

239
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,969
That's not self acceptance,
that's self judgement.

240
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,538
We don't do that here.

241
00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:00,579
I wasn't talking about me.

242
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,085
Cool. Right, so I'm gonna to
go...

243
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:11,223
Not that this hasn't been weird
and extremely awkward but...

244
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,058
Yeah...

245
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:14,660
You're not going anywhere.

246
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:22,833
Jack...

247
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,204
- Jack, you don't wanna do this...
- Shut up.

248
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,108
Turn around.

249
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,621
Look at me.

250
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:45,257
I haven't seen your face.

251
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,535
You could just walk out of here
and I wouldn't say anything.

252
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,796
Look. At. Me.

253
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,302
So you're the funny guy, eh?

254
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:00,873
Always telling jokes. Never
taking it seriously.

255
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,610
Not so funny anymore, is it?

256
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,214
Jack, you need to calm down.

257
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,883
Whatever it is that you want.

258
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,370
This isn't the way to go about
it.

259
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:16,655
No, I'd say it's exactly the
way to go about it.

260
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,557
Well let's talk about that.

261
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,792
Let's talk about what you want.

262
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,596
I want you to take this
seriously.

263
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,572
You come in here. Sit in your
circle.

264
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,270
Talking about fucking higher
powers.

265
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,539
Thinking that's enough.

266
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,779
You've no idea what real
recovery is.

267
00:19:41,746 --> 00:19:43,348
What it takes.

268
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:47,886
How much it fuckling hurts.

269
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:58,463
And not just you...

270
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:09,668
Sit the fuck down.

271
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:16,041
Sit the fuck down.

272
00:21:19,143 --> 00:21:20,143
You.

273
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,381
Take these. Tie them up.

274
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:29,954
It's okay...

275
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:31,289
It's gonna be okay...

276
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,270
Just gotta keep the pressure
on... just keep the pressure on...

277
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:35,960
Just gotta keep the pressure on.

278
00:21:36,494 --> 00:21:37,896
Get in the circle.

279
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:41,600
Get in the circle.

280
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,001
The erm...

281
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:44,202
Get in the circle.

282
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:45,971
If I move, she'll bleed to
death.

283
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,008
Get in the circle.

284
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:55,146
There's probably a first aid kit
in the kitchen, If I could just...

285
00:21:58,717 --> 00:21:59,918
Fuck.

286
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:46,898
Do you want something?

287
00:22:48,466 --> 00:22:49,935
For the pain?

288
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:55,941
Well, I'm sure someone here's
got something...

289
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,044
Ask them.

290
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:01,846
You're dying.

291
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,615
No-one would judge you.

292
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,420
Ask them.

293
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,794
Ask them.

294
00:23:25,236 --> 00:23:26,738
Is someone else here?

295
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,979
Yes? No?

296
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:39,651
What am I going to find if I go
out through there?

297
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,051
Nothing.

298
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:42,352
What was that?

299
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,688
Nothing.

300
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,159
We'll see about that.

301
00:24:56,794 --> 00:24:58,897
Probably wondering why I'm here.

302
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,934
Who I am.

303
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,608
Believe it or not, I'm here to
help you.

304
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:16,882
You come here every week,
looking for change.

305
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,253
Something to make a difference.

306
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,790
Well, here it is.

307
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:30,495
Your "higher power".

308
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,768
Why are you doing this?

309
00:25:37,568 --> 00:25:39,538
We haven't done anything wrong.

310
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,145
You sure about that?

311
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,616
Shit.

312
00:25:53,384 --> 00:25:54,953
Here's what we're gonna do.

313
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:58,122
We're gonna go around the circle.

314
00:25:58,255 --> 00:26:01,293
Talk about what's in here.

315
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,095
What you've done.

316
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:12,804
And I want each of you to tell
me.

317
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,944
Show me.

318
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,815
Why you deserve to walk out
that door.

319
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,187
Why I should let you.

320
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:52,978
Don't look at them. They can't
help you.

321
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,152
Do you want to tell them who
this is for?

322
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,255
I think you do.

323
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:05,923
I think you want to tell us

324
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,627
I think you want to get it off
your chest.

325
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:10,929
Get it out in the open.

326
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,765
My son. It's for my son.

327
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:15,767
Your son?

328
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,636
He live with you?

329
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:22,439
With my mother.

330
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:24,474
With your mother?

331
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,344
Why is he with your mother?

332
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:31,916
Why does he live with your
mother?

333
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,388
I was a mess.

334
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:41,159
I needed to get high so I left
him in the house.

335
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:47,165
You left him in the house?

336
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:49,734
It wasn't going to be for long.

337
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:51,903
I thought he'd be okay.

338
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:56,808
I just lost track of time and
when I got back...

339
00:27:59,443 --> 00:28:00,644
He was so brave.

340
00:28:00,978 --> 00:28:04,215
He didn't cry for the first few
hours.

341
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,152
The neighbours heard and...

342
00:28:11,722 --> 00:28:12,990
He's my son.

343
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:14,993
He belongs with his mother.

344
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:19,297
What would you say to him?

345
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:22,100
If he was here right now?

346
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:27,272
It's difficult, I know,
bringing all this back up.

347
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:29,841
Okay, okay.

348
00:28:35,546 --> 00:28:37,015
We're gonna try something.

349
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,319
You're gonna talk to me as if I
was your boy.

350
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
What?

351
00:28:43,488 --> 00:28:44,322
Well, it's an exercise.

352
00:28:44,455 --> 00:28:45,455
He isn't here.

353
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,992
This way you can talk to him.

354
00:28:48,926 --> 00:28:51,830
Get everything off your chest.

355
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,264
I don't know...

356
00:28:54,665 --> 00:28:55,775
She doesn't have to do this.

357
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:57,135
Yes she does.

358
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:01,172
I want you to apologise.

359
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,741
To me

360
00:29:03,474 --> 00:29:04,474
your son

361
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:05,944
right now.

362
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:12,417
I'm sorry Liam I...

363
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,219
Why are you sorry?

364
00:29:14,952 --> 00:29:16,554
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

365
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,690
- You had a choice.
- No, I didn't.

366
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,057
Yes you did, yes you did

367
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,360
you had a choice to be a
mother...

368
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,330
You had a choice to be a mother
or smack head

369
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:28,766
- and you chose drugs over me, isn't that right?
- No...

370
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,668
It's not... it's not...

371
00:29:30,801 --> 00:29:31,801
Why do you hate me?

372
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:32,669
I don't.

373
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:34,906
Yes you do.

374
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,684
- I don't. I love you. Please, don't say that.
- Ever since you found out you were knocked up.

375
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:38,576
You've hated me.

376
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,745
Ever since I was born.

377
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:41,978
Why do you hate me?

378
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:43,981
Please don't say that.

379
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,327
- Why do you hate me? Why do you hate me?
- I'd do anything for you. I don't hate you.

380
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:48,719
WHY DO YOU HATE ME?

381
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:52,924
Because you make me realise
what a fucking terrible person I am.

382
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,437
I didn't... I didn't mean... I
didn't mean...

383
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:08,705
I didn't...

384
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:15,479
Don't judge me.

385
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,549
Don't you dare judge me.

386
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:21,685
You don't have the fucking
right. None of you.

387
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,221
The things you've done.

388
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:25,456
No-one's judging you.

389
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:27,258
Fuck you man, she's right.

390
00:30:28,826 --> 00:30:30,895
None of you has the right to
judge anyone.

391
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:32,263
Henry, what are you doing?

392
00:30:32,396 --> 00:30:33,396
Leave it.

393
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:35,533
Won't do you any good listening
to him.

394
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,334
He's scared.

395
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:38,736
Talking shit.

396
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:39,904
Aren't you Henry?

397
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:42,140
No, I'm talking complete
fucking sense.

398
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,409
I'm not dying for you, you
piece of shit.

399
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,177
This is your mess.

400
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,124
That's what this is about right?

401
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:49,422
They've done something to you?

402
00:30:49,446 --> 00:30:50,446
Fucked you over?

403
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,481
I get it.

404
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:52,682
You're pissed off.

405
00:30:52,816 --> 00:30:53,885
Really, really pissed off.

406
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,521
But I'm not the guy you want.

407
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:57,689
Is that so?

408
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:59,290
Henry, stop talking now.

409
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,726
Maybe the plastic cop got a bit
too big for his boots, eh?

410
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,627
Arrested somebody he shouldn't
have?

411
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,305
Wouldn't be the first time
would it Davey?

412
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:06,864
You've got some fucking balls
son.

413
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,867
And this bitch. "Some things
you can't make right?"

414
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,636
Her own fucking words.

415
00:31:12,336 --> 00:31:15,006
And this guy, oh you'll love
this one.

416
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,974
Henry, you need to calm the
fuck down mate.

417
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:18,809
Steals a fuck ton of drugs from
his dealer

418
00:31:18,942 --> 00:31:21,288
- and let's his buddy take the rap for it.
- You need to stop this now.

419
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:23,023
How many bin bags was it they
found him in again?

420
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,581
You prick. You fucking prick.

421
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:25,849
It's caught up with you man.

422
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:27,063
I'm not like these junkies.

423
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:28,386
These fucking liars.

424
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:29,619
All this talking...

425
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:35,025
It's just hot air isn't it?

426
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,594
A whole lot of nothing.

427
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,796
Oh god... oh god...

428
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:40,865
You can't talk your way out of
this one

429
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:42,233
not with me Henry.

430
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,568
She didn't tell me she was
married

431
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,604
I swear to you, I swear.

432
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,409
I tired to break it off

433
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:52,676
I tried you know

434
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,345
but she said she'd...

435
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:57,414
I didn't think she'd actually
do it

436
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,217
otherwise I would've...

437
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,452
It wasn't my fault.

438
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:07,091
She wasn't my wife.

439
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,060
She wasn't?

440
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
No.

441
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,666
But she was somebody's.

442
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:19,304
You're just like the rest of
them, Henry.

443
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,006
You're a piece of shit.

444
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,277
Say it Henry, say: "I'm a piece
of shit".

445
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,146
I'm a piece of shit.

446
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,282
You're a piece of shit.

447
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:37,555
I feel like we're making
progress, don't you?

448
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:43,161
Right, who's next?

449
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:48,832
Fuck it.

450
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:11,155
And fuck you too.

451
00:33:39,116 --> 00:33:40,351
When I first came here.

452
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:43,187
I couldn't help but feel that
you were all

453
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,356
labouring under the
misapprehension

454
00:33:45,489 --> 00:33:47,425
that you somehow didn't deserve
this.

455
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,263
That you were decent people.

456
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,967
Well, I'm glad we've managed to
come to an understanding

457
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,236
on that front.

458
00:34:03,974 --> 00:34:07,612
Well, some of you at least.

459
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:14,452
You've got a daughter.

460
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,323
It's not a question, it's an
observation.

461
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:24,195
See, men with daughters have
this 'look'.

462
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,598
They wanna protect them so they
see everyone

463
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,866
pretty much as a threat.

464
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:29,867
Isn't that right Dave?

465
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,169
Careful!

466
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,271
You'll hurt yourself.

467
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,841
Or someone else.

468
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,512
You know, you can frighten this
lot

469
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,014
throwing chairs around

470
00:34:44,648 --> 00:34:47,185
pointing that pop-gun at
people...

471
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,153
But me?

472
00:34:51,154 --> 00:34:52,757
I've got your number mate.

473
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:03,201
I really don't think you have.

474
00:35:10,674 --> 00:35:11,674
I tell you what

475
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,844
why don't I make a start

476
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:16,647
just join in when you feel up
to it, okay?

477
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:22,620
"To Jenny"

478
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,889
"my daughter."

479
00:35:28,792 --> 00:35:32,029
"I've respected your wishes and
kept my distance."

480
00:35:32,162 --> 00:35:34,832
"It hasn't always been easy."

481
00:35:34,965 --> 00:35:39,237
"You are and always have been
the dearest thing in my life."

482
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,808
"I wish you could say the same
about me."

483
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:48,813
"In the past I failed myself."

484
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:52,850
"I failed you."

485
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,153
"I was worthless."

486
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:58,823
"Not fit to be your father."

487
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,658
This is really good stuff, Dave.

488
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:01,958
Really riveting.

489
00:36:02,759 --> 00:36:06,197
You should channel this into
poetry or something.

490
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:11,135
"I don't remember the things
you said I did to you."

491
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:16,007
"I want to believe that it
wasn't me who did them."

492
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:20,478
"That I couldn't do that to my
own daughter"

493
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,848
"but I know that's not true."

494
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:29,954
What did you do, David?

495
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,892
What did you do, Dave?

496
00:36:36,226 --> 00:36:37,862
It was the drink.

497
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,530
Not me.

498
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,034
I didn't know what I was
doing...

499
00:36:44,367 --> 00:36:46,103
I didn't know what I was...

500
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:55,246
She was your daughter, you sick
bastard!

501
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:00,950
Do it.

502
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,653
Just do it.

503
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:05,223
I thought this was
about what's fair.

504
00:37:08,659 --> 00:37:09,794
Please.

505
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,047
Now I know it's just about you
getting your rocks off.

506
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,068
If you'd have read what was in
here

507
00:37:18,535 --> 00:37:20,271
you'd know he deserved that.

508
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,591
Somethings you can't make right.

509
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:44,495
Makes you wonder...

510
00:37:45,362 --> 00:37:46,697
You think you've got something?

511
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:49,099
Call a cop.

512
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:50,033
This is her first night here.

513
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,200
Alright?

514
00:37:51,234 --> 00:37:52,245
She doesn't have a letter.

515
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,309
She doesn't know anything.

516
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:54,837
She came in here.

517
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,307
She sat in that chair.

518
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,709
Figure she's got something to
get off her chest.

519
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,612
Something she wants to tell us
all?

520
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:06,651
You stole something?

521
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:09,920
Hurt someone?

522
00:38:11,421 --> 00:38:12,757
Fucked someone?

523
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,566
Do that to yourself?

524
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,804
Well whatever it is, you must
really hate yourself for it.

525
00:38:27,604 --> 00:38:29,173
I came here for the free coffee.

526
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,776
You came here because you've
got nowhere else to go.

527
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,446
Do you want to take something
from me?

528
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:37,714
Friends?

529
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:39,350
Family?

530
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,718
Self respect?

531
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:43,921
I have nothing left for you to
take.

532
00:38:44,788 --> 00:38:46,424
You think you've hit rock
bottom?

533
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,131
Well guess what?

534
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,135
I brought a fucking shovel.

535
00:38:58,702 --> 00:39:00,403
- Hey, woah, woah...
- What are you doing?

536
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:01,537
What the fuck?

537
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:02,571
Jack, what are you doing?

538
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,807
Where are you taking me man?

539
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,419
Jack... Jack, you're talking to
me, not him.

540
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:06,443
Oh fuck...

541
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,088
Nothing left for me to take

542
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,112
that's what you said.

543
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,501
So, I guess I'll take it from
him.

544
00:39:11,548 --> 00:39:13,084
Oh shit... oh shit...

545
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:14,627
No, no don't do this.
Please!

546
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:17,154
I... erm... I don't know what you
want.

547
00:39:17,387 --> 00:39:18,756
I wanna know why you're here.

548
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:22,092
What you did that was so
terrible.

549
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:23,728
I stole things.

550
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,129
What things?

551
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:26,496
What things? Erm...

552
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,799
- Try Harder.
- Okay, okay.

553
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:30,933
Try harder.

554
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:35,573
Okay, okay... Just... just... just
let me think...

555
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:44,314
I swear to Christ, I will burn
his fucking face off.

556
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:47,184
What do you want?

557
00:39:47,317 --> 00:39:49,153
I want to know why you're here.

558
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,187
What did you do?

559
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:54,825
What did you do that was so
fucking bad?

560
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,140
It was my fault.

561
00:40:10,006 --> 00:40:11,542
What was your fault?

562
00:40:18,114 --> 00:40:19,114
I...

563
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,922
No...

564
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,693
No... no... no... NO!

565
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,797
If anything happens whilst I'm
gone, anything I don't like.

566
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,501
I won't hesitate to shoot every
last one of you.

567
00:40:37,634 --> 00:40:39,170
Do you understand?

568
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,205
Good.

569
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,021
Oh Christ!

570
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:01,292
What the fuck are you doing?

571
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,860
You heard what he said.

572
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:08,898
Eddy?

573
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,936
Great, the cavalry's arrived.

574
00:41:15,338 --> 00:41:16,707
I managed to distract him.

575
00:41:17,874 --> 00:41:19,643
I don't know for how long.

576
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:21,344
We gotta go.

577
00:41:21,678 --> 00:41:23,013
We gotta go now.

578
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,652
You need a hand there buddy?

579
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:34,091
No. Everything's fine here,
I've got it under control.

580
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,297
Fuck,
fuck, FUCK! He's fucking locked it!

581
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,166
Jesus. They really did a number
on her.

582
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,011
Like I said. Everything's fine...

583
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:46,736
Bunch of fucking animals around
here.

584
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:49,206
Didn't always used to be like
this, let me tell you.

585
00:41:51,374 --> 00:41:52,374
Hey.

586
00:41:52,509 --> 00:41:53,553
Do you want me to call the
police?

587
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:54,845
Oh that won't be necessary...

588
00:41:58,214 --> 00:41:59,517
It's good to see you man.

589
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:02,118
He can't be here.

590
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,121
You can't be here!

591
00:42:04,921 --> 00:42:07,057
If he finds you, he'll kill us.

592
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,558
He'll kill us all!

593
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:10,761
He'll fucking kill us anyway.

594
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,030
Fuck!

595
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:15,398
I can't... They won't...

596
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,266
Eddy...

597
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:17,399
The phones...

598
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,837
The lock box... the lock box on
the table.

599
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,209
Uh, the keys?

600
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:26,542
I...

601
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,344
Where are the fucking keys?

602
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,444
I don't know.

603
00:42:28,478 --> 00:42:29,179
Come on, come!

604
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:30,080
He's got them!

605
00:42:30,246 --> 00:42:31,782
Don't do this to me!

606
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,509
It's in the cupboard.

607
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:37,253
There's a phone in the cupboard.

608
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:38,288
To the left of the door.

609
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:39,756
Come on, Eddy.

610
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:41,334
- That's a fucking shame...
- You really don't have to...

611
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:42,635
See, the insurance companies man

612
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:44,299
they'll screw you without a
police report.

613
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,798
You've done enough already.

614
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:48,998
Where is it?

615
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:50,165
Where is it?!

616
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:51,368
Do you see it?

617
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:52,369
How do we even know it's there?

618
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,037
It's there. Trust me.

619
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,038
I got it.

620
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:56,205
I got it!

621
00:42:57,374 --> 00:42:59,214
Why can't you get any fucking
signal down here!

622
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,244
Eddy...

623
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:01,884
It's time for you to take your
phone.

624
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:04,079
To go home...

625
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:05,549
Uh... it's fine... I don't.

626
00:43:05,682 --> 00:43:06,959
What? You don't want your phone?

627
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:08,619
Or you don't want to go home?

628
00:43:09,285 --> 00:43:10,654
I just... I don't...

629
00:43:10,787 --> 00:43:11,588
You 'just' what?

630
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:13,790
You 'don't' what?

631
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:15,359
I don't want any trouble.

632
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,626
Please.

633
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:17,994
Eddy...

634
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:19,563
The window!

635
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,140
It's the only place where you
can get any fucking signal.

636
00:43:21,164 --> 00:43:22,164
Come on!

637
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,805
Please work... please work...

638
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:31,609
It's a joke.

639
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,376
Joke?

640
00:43:33,743 --> 00:43:34,743
Yeah.

641
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,313
Joke.

642
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:38,681
Here.

643
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:40,149
Take it.

644
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,720
Get yourself off home.

645
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,722
Please work... please work...

646
00:43:48,391 --> 00:43:49,391
What was that?

647
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,060
It was nothing.

648
00:43:51,628 --> 00:43:52,462
Everything's fine.

649
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:53,297
I should probably be...

650
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,265
No, no, no...

651
00:44:09,846 --> 00:44:11,281
What's happening?

652
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,616
He's... he's killed him.

653
00:44:12,749 --> 00:44:15,252
Oh fuck... no...

654
00:44:16,387 --> 00:44:17,821
Please...

655
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:24,727
Eddy...

656
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,195
Eddy!

657
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,598
You need to get back to the
roof.

658
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,267
I can't... there's no time...

659
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,477
Then you need to make the call.

660
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:32,701
You need to make the call now.

661
00:44:32,802 --> 00:44:34,838
We're fucked. We're completely
fucked.

662
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:36,415
Well, we're not getting out of
this on our own.

663
00:44:36,439 --> 00:44:38,575
If he comes back and realises
we've called for help

664
00:44:38,808 --> 00:44:40,353
you think he's going to wait
for the police?

665
00:44:40,377 --> 00:44:43,213
He's gonna put a bullet in each
of our fucking heads!

666
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:50,387
We need to rethink this.

667
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,921
Don't listen to him Eddy.

668
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:53,733
There's no time, you're gonna
get us all fucking killed.

669
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,068
Eddy, you need to keep it
together.

670
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,869
I'm not putting my life in this
fuck up's hands.

671
00:44:56,893 --> 00:44:58,027
Back off Henry.

672
00:44:58,161 --> 00:44:59,763
Don't listen to them Eddy,
listen to me.

673
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,530
You can do this.

674
00:45:00,663 --> 00:45:01,431
This is suicide.

675
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:02,564
Eddy... please...

676
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,182
Make the bleeding call.

677
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:19,716
It's 999.

678
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,290
How on earth are you fucking
this up?

679
00:45:21,418 --> 00:45:22,418
Do it!

680
00:45:23,587 --> 00:45:24,587
Fuck, fuck fuck...

681
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:25,221
DO IT!

682
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:26,924
999!

683
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,393
Yes, YES!

684
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:01,490
Here?

685
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,333
Unbe-fucking-lievable.

686
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,513
Jesus.

687
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,448
That's a lot of gear.

688
00:46:26,582 --> 00:46:27,582
So you're like what?

689
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:29,887
A drug dealer now?

690
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:34,023
So, how does that work then?

691
00:46:35,091 --> 00:46:37,451
You keep close to the ones who
look like they're struggling.

692
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,163
Offer to help them out?

693
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:42,900
And all this time I was blaming
myself.

694
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:46,569
I never gave anyone anything
they didn't ask for.

695
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:48,305
Do you really believe that?

696
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,041
Or is it just something you say
to make it easier?

697
00:46:53,543 --> 00:46:56,346
It's funny, when I first came
here I actually felt safe.

698
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,483
Like for once, somebody
actually had my back.

699
00:47:01,751 --> 00:47:03,320
Guess I know the truth now
though.

700
00:47:05,388 --> 00:47:06,388
What's that?

701
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,660
We're just a bunch of people,
sat in a circle

702
00:47:10,793 --> 00:47:12,496
waiting for our turn to talk.

703
00:47:19,936 --> 00:47:21,238
Disappointing.

704
00:47:22,572 --> 00:47:25,008
Not exactly unexpected but still

705
00:47:27,677 --> 00:47:29,012
disappointing.

706
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:34,117
I found this

707
00:47:36,452 --> 00:47:37,554
in the bathroom.

708
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:42,893
In the bathroom!

709
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:45,996
Just can't help yourself, can
you?

710
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:49,633
You get this from him?

711
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:53,637
S-sometimes.

712
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,906
Sometimes.

713
00:47:59,575 --> 00:48:02,412
Does that sound like something
a friend would do?

714
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,415
Someone trying to help you?

715
00:48:07,216 --> 00:48:08,216
No.

716
00:48:09,018 --> 00:48:10,654
You're in luck Eddy.

717
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:15,192
Because I am your friend.

718
00:48:18,561 --> 00:48:20,197
And I am here to help you.

719
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:23,200
When I was about twelve

720
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,700
thirteen

721
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:27,304
I was a real shit.

722
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:29,705
Fights.

723
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,208
Girls.

724
00:48:33,576 --> 00:48:34,844
Broken windows.

725
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:38,248
One day, my Dad catches me
smoking.

726
00:48:40,283 --> 00:48:42,652
Usual teenage bullshit, right?

727
00:48:42,852 --> 00:48:44,154
No problem, right?

728
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:47,391
Except

729
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:49,393
he'd watched his Mum

730
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:52,029
my Grandmother

731
00:48:53,162 --> 00:48:54,598
die of lung cancer.

732
00:48:56,566 --> 00:49:00,003
And he'd be damned if he'd have
the same thing happen to his son.

733
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:03,040
So.

734
00:49:06,776 --> 00:49:08,445
He takes the packet

735
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:14,351
and tells me to smoke the
entire thing.

736
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,723
I was sick as a dog, but.

737
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,625
I tell you.

738
00:49:23,092 --> 00:49:25,228
I never smoked another
cigarette.

739
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:43,113
You think your boy over there
can tell us how much this weighs?

740
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:46,316
About an ounce.

741
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:50,354
About an ounce.

742
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:54,657
Didn't need scales or anything.

743
00:49:54,857 --> 00:49:56,093
Are you serious?

744
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,193
Even half that would kill him.

745
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:02,032
Every day he's killing himself.
Every day.

746
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,066
Here.

747
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,236
Please...

748
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,138
Anything worth doing.

749
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,872
Please...

750
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,709
Comes with a certain level of
risk, that's what my Dad taught me.

751
00:50:13,142 --> 00:50:14,711
You get through this.

752
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:19,082
I guarantee you'll never touch
this shit again.

753
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:24,488
Don't listen to him Ed, he's
just trying to fuck with you.

754
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,960
Oh, you think they're looking
out for you like I am?

755
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,094
Right?

756
00:50:33,062 --> 00:50:33,729
Alright, alright.

757
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:34,863
Okay, okay.

758
00:50:35,398 --> 00:50:36,933
One... two... three... four.

759
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,402
Why don't you help him out?

760
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:44,341
All this will boil his fucking
brains, let's be honest but

761
00:50:46,776 --> 00:50:47,776
a fifth of it...

762
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,113
You might all just get through
that.

763
00:50:50,613 --> 00:50:53,517
Course, that mean going back to
square one.

764
00:50:55,751 --> 00:50:56,820
All those months...

765
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,155
Years

766
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:00,824
of recovery, just...

767
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:04,393
Gone.

768
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,699
But I'm sure he's totally worth
it.

769
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:10,833
Right?

770
00:51:17,273 --> 00:51:18,274
Guys?

771
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:20,277
Please don't let him kill me.

772
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,813
Don't let him kill me.

773
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:25,782
Please.

774
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:27,517
Twenty eight grams.

775
00:51:28,551 --> 00:51:30,886
An ounce is about twenty eight
grams.

776
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:32,588
That's five point six each.

777
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:33,722
Jesus.

778
00:51:33,756 --> 00:51:35,725
Had a mate do three once.

779
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,961
His heart was pounding like you
wouldn't believe

780
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:40,339
his temperature went through
the roof

781
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:41,865
his muscles seized up.

782
00:51:43,232 --> 00:51:45,235
Didn't even yell for help.

783
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:48,872
He couldn't.

784
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:54,844
Maybe... maybe we have more of a
tolerance.

785
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:57,013
Yeah? Maybe it's cut with
baking soda or some shit..

786
00:51:57,146 --> 00:51:59,666
- I don't know...
- Maybe? How can you not know what's in there?

787
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:03,186
Look, I just sell it, alright? I don't
know what it's fucking cut with.

788
00:52:04,554 --> 00:52:05,955
Fantastic.

789
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,125
So I could end up with a nostril
full of ground glass or baking soda?

790
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:11,070
You really have no way of
knowing what's in there?

791
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:13,894
If we don't do this, we might as
well be pulling the trigger ourselves.

792
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,565
Okay, you go first then.

793
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,067
Or him, or her

794
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,836
I owe him shit.

795
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,437
You're a fucking coward Henry.

796
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:22,571
I'll do it.

797
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:26,143
I'll do it.

798
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,251
We're a support group, right?

799
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:14,623
It's good.

800
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,327
Safe.

801
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:23,667
Carries on like this, you just
might be in luck.

802
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:30,507
So what? What? We gonna do this?

803
00:53:33,442 --> 00:53:35,979
Bit more... bit more.

804
00:53:44,286 --> 00:53:46,889
Fuck!

805
00:53:47,022 --> 00:53:49,459
Yes, God.

806
00:53:52,328 --> 00:53:55,966
This guy, this guy...

807
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:08,411
Two years.

808
00:54:11,648 --> 00:54:15,018
That's what black means right?
Two years?

809
00:54:19,722 --> 00:54:22,592
I doubt they've got more than
two years between them.

810
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:25,962
That's why it's so easy for them
to throw it all away. But you?

811
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:29,966
You have a future.

812
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,236
A son.

813
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:37,131
Don't listen to him Charley, he's
just trying to get inside your head.

814
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:40,844
You have to ask yourself.

815
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:45,649
Is he worth throwing it all
away for?

816
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:03,633
I can't.

817
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,801
I can't do this.

818
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:06,935
What? No.

819
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,038
Look, where are you going? She
doesn't mean it.

820
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,132
Tell him you don't mean it.
Tell him you'll do it.

821
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,942
I'm so sorry.

822
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:19,082
I promised my son I wouldn't
let him down. I promised.

823
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,718
I promised.

824
00:55:24,888 --> 00:55:27,590
Well sure looks like you two
have got your work cut out.

825
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:28,724
You bastard.

826
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:30,827
I didn't do this.

827
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:35,130
Every decision, every choice - choices
he made - has brought him to this point.

828
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:39,068
No, that's not true. He's
trying to get better, he's trying.

829
00:55:39,568 --> 00:55:42,105
You think he's going to have
some epiphany?

830
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:44,139
He's gonna stop?

831
00:55:46,475 --> 00:55:48,345
Turn it all around?

832
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:50,480
He's not.

833
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:57,854
If he doesn't die tonight, he's
dead in six months. A year tops.

834
00:56:04,727 --> 00:56:06,463
Are we gonna do this or what?

835
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:18,074
Go on then.

836
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:20,977
What are you waiting for?

837
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,772
We're not finished yet.

838
00:56:50,839 --> 00:56:51,839
Hey!

839
00:56:52,008 --> 00:56:53,943
Hey Jack, can't you see that
she's had enough?

840
00:56:54,076 --> 00:56:56,479
Yeah, I can hear her fucking
heart pounding from here.

841
00:56:57,713 --> 00:56:58,713
Kara

842
00:56:59,148 --> 00:57:02,819
Kara, you're not gonna save
him. Not like this.

843
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:06,121
For fuck's sake, you're gonna
kill yourself!

844
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,725
What do I look like? Some kind
of light weight?

845
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:13,663
What is driving that engine of
yours?

846
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:20,437
Aw Jesus.

847
00:57:23,806 --> 00:57:25,808
I think you've had enough for
tonight sweetheart.

848
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:28,645
No... stop. Stop.

849
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:34,517
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

850
00:57:46,395 --> 00:57:50,133
Do you think she'd be saying that if
she knew that this was all your fault?

851
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,504
Do you know.

852
00:57:56,805 --> 00:57:59,742
I was hurting for so long

853
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,213
but this

854
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,250
this gave me freedom.

855
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:12,055
Gave me a reason to keep
breathing.

856
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,091
You sent me this letter.

857
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,126
You helped me.

858
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,263
All this

859
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:23,633
was you.

860
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:36,713
It can't be. It can't be.

861
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:39,082
Yes it can.

862
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,822
A going away present.

863
00:58:47,589 --> 00:58:49,592
You earned it.

864
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:58,902
Hey, hey Jack! You ain't gotta
do this.

865
00:59:00,302 --> 00:59:03,139
Yeah... I-I-I can do some more...

866
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:07,643
Okay? W-W-We can all do some
more if someone would fucking help.

867
00:59:08,477 --> 00:59:11,214
I'm done man and you are too.

868
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:21,958
If you don't do this

869
00:59:23,392 --> 00:59:24,727
they all die.

870
00:59:26,528 --> 00:59:29,131
One by one, they all die.

871
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:33,970
Sorry, it's my fault I...

872
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,839
I didn't...

873
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:39,342
I'm sorry.

874
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:13,876
Sorry...

875
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,780
You keep saying that.

876
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,153
Sorry for what?

877
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,188
Leave her alone, she's had
enough.

878
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:27,321
No she hasn't.

879
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:32,362
You know for someone who's lost
everything

880
01:00:34,329 --> 01:00:36,899
I've never known anyone cling
on as much as you.

881
01:00:45,307 --> 01:00:46,843
What's your secret?

882
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:48,344
Muh-muh...

883
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,816
Oh it looks like we're having a
breakthrough.

884
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:59,022
Muh-muh...

885
01:00:59,488 --> 01:01:00,823
Mother?

886
01:01:03,692 --> 01:01:05,828
Is that what it's come to?
Mother?

887
01:01:09,132 --> 01:01:11,034
Murderer.

888
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,071
Murderer?

889
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:27,349
Why can you not appreciate what
it is I'm trying to do here?

890
01:01:27,583 --> 01:01:31,187
- You killed Ellen... Dave... Eddy...
- Oh no, no, no. Don't you dare... Don't you dare!

891
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:35,491
You... you brought this on
yourselves.

892
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:40,196
These... these lives you live.
The things you do., the...

893
01:01:41,396 --> 01:01:42,565
Fuck. You fucking know it.

894
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:44,700
You fucking know.

895
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:46,035
Get off me! Get off me!

896
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:48,637
What would someone have to do
to deserve this?

897
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:50,372
One. Two. Three.

898
01:01:50,505 --> 01:01:54,343
I mean, they'd really have to
hate themselves for it, right?

899
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,913
Four. Five. Six.

900
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,950
So imagine you have a daughter.

901
01:02:02,551 --> 01:02:04,420
A little girl.

902
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,959
And she meant everything to you.

903
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,161
No...

904
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:19,001
Imagine the people that were
supposed to help her.

905
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:24,240
As you can see we have
a new face this evening.

906
01:02:24,706 --> 01:02:26,008
My name's Beck.

907
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,046
Hello Beck.

908
01:02:33,482 --> 01:02:35,484
Take advantage of her.

909
01:02:36,418 --> 01:02:39,589
Spread your toes. You
don't want to leave any marks.

910
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,824
Drag her down to their level.

911
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:48,630
And they leave her there to die.

912
01:02:49,298 --> 01:02:52,110
- Beck? We were just there... we were just...
- Kara, Kara, look at me...

913
01:02:52,134 --> 01:02:53,870
Kara look at me. Look at me
Kara.

914
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,839
We need to get the fuck out of
here right now, okay?

915
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,911
What do you think they'd
deserve?

916
01:03:04,713 --> 01:03:06,048
One cut?

917
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,885
Three?

918
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:14,857
How much to make that right?

919
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,028
Oh my god...

920
01:03:20,829 --> 01:03:24,032
Oh my god it's him.

921
01:03:24,166 --> 01:03:28,237
What the fuck is this? What's
going on?

922
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,340
What did you fucking do?

923
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,209
Beck.

924
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:36,913
That's who we are talking about
right?

925
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,918
Y'know, she always said her dad
was nuts.

926
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,287
Oh, is that right?

927
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:49,525
She'd fallen off the program.
She needed help.

928
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:53,696
So she came to you?

929
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,332
Yeah, cause she was scared of
you.

930
01:03:59,568 --> 01:04:03,873
Afraid of what you'd do, in case you found
out that she got kicked out the group.

931
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:09,244
Charley spoke to me, I spoke to
some people and got what she needed.

932
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:10,779
What she needed...

933
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:14,350
We were trying to help her
through withdrawal.

934
01:04:14,984 --> 01:04:16,819
Couple of days, that's all it
was.

935
01:04:17,386 --> 01:04:21,858
We'd take turns watching her.
She didn't want to be alone.

936
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,037
Spread your toes. You don't
want to leave any marks.

937
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:40,610
Kara...

938
01:04:42,544 --> 01:04:44,080
Please don't go.

939
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,083
And I wasn't strong enough.

940
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:53,656
Beck? Beck? Hey, hey
Beck?

941
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:56,992
Kara, Kara get the fuck up.

942
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,193
What the fuck is going on?

943
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,662
Beck, look at me. Open your
eyes.

944
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:02,497
Kara? Kara, call a fucking
ambulance!

945
01:05:02,631 --> 01:05:05,701
What the fuck did you do? What
the fuck did you do?

946
01:05:05,834 --> 01:05:07,802
Kara call a fucking ambulance!

947
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:11,173
I didn't know she was still on
the script.

948
01:05:12,107 --> 01:05:13,985
You should never use when
you're still on the script.

949
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:17,246
You left her in some fucking
shit hole!

950
01:05:20,515 --> 01:05:22,184
My little girl.

951
01:05:23,885 --> 01:05:25,520
It wasn't her fault.

952
01:05:25,654 --> 01:05:27,089
Oh I keep hearing that.

953
01:05:27,756 --> 01:05:32,962
It's not my fault... I didn't do
this... I don't deserve this.

954
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:35,197
It was my idea to dry her out.

955
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:37,566
My idea to leave her there. I...

956
01:05:40,869 --> 01:05:42,405
I sold it to her.

957
01:05:47,342 --> 01:05:53,148
I thought that was the person
that I wanted to be. It wasn't.

958
01:05:53,448 --> 01:05:56,686
And it was a fucking shit way
to find out but...

959
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:06,094
If anyone deserves this, it's
me. No-one else.

960
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:11,467
Well, they didn't stop you,
they didn't help her.

961
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:14,069
Didn't speak up.

962
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:15,738
It wasn't like that.

963
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:17,872
If they'd of found out what
we'd done.

964
01:06:18,273 --> 01:06:19,984
They would never have let me
see my son again.

965
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:22,444
I couldn't risk that happening,
I couldn't...

966
01:06:22,577 --> 01:06:24,146
Yes, you could!

967
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:26,748
But you didn't.

968
01:06:27,015 --> 01:06:28,917
You had a choice.

969
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:32,655
Just like him, like her...

970
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:36,157
And look how it worked out for
them.

971
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:37,736
Mate, mate this has got.

972
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:39,095
Shut up!

973
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:45,468
When I came here, I said one
thing above all things.

974
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,042
Prove to me you deserve to walk
out that door.

975
01:06:56,211 --> 01:07:04,211
The only thing you've proven, is
that you're liars, junkies, cheats...

976
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:13,228
Monsters, one and all.

977
01:07:13,328 --> 01:07:16,332
It's not true. It's not.

978
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:20,636
Give me one good reason why I
shouldn't fucking kill them now.

979
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:28,444
Seth takes his nephew out and
plays football with him every weekend.

980
01:07:29,578 --> 01:07:30,579
Every weekend.

981
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:36,752
And Charley loves her son. She
loves him so much.

982
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:41,390
And Henry might be a prick but
he hasn't killed anybody.

983
01:07:42,257 --> 01:07:44,193
He didn't even know she existed.

984
01:07:44,993 --> 01:07:46,562
Go on. Get the fuck out of here.

985
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:48,363
He's going nowhere.

986
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:51,600
- Come on, come on. Think about your boy!
- What about Seth? What about Seth?

987
01:07:51,967 --> 01:07:52,967
Seth!

988
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:10,086
You missed someone.

989
01:08:14,089 --> 01:08:15,257
Or maybe you didn't.

990
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:24,166
A life for a life.

991
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:26,368
Whose fault is it?

992
01:08:27,702 --> 01:08:29,138
You?

993
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:31,040
Or you?

994
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:33,275
Jack, Jack we both know it's me.

995
01:08:33,475 --> 01:08:37,279
No Seth, it's not. It's my
fault.

996
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,915
I'm everything he says I am.

997
01:08:40,048 --> 01:08:41,048
It's my fault.

998
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:43,085
Jack, it's my fault. It's me.

999
01:08:43,218 --> 01:08:45,697
- No, Seth. No-one else needs to die because of me.
- Kara. Kara, it's fine really.

1000
01:08:45,721 --> 01:08:48,457
- No, please, please.
- Kara. Kara!

1001
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:53,229
It's okay.

1002
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,433
What do I do?

1003
01:08:58,067 --> 01:08:59,368
Just live.

1004
01:09:00,969 --> 01:09:04,640
It's not just enough to know
what you've done...

1005
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:06,575
You have to do it.

1006
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:27,496
Do you feel any fucking better
now?

1007
01:09:37,305 --> 01:09:41,577
No. No I don't.
